# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## DESCRIPTION

Modified a starter code in Javascript so that users are able to generate a random password based on the options they selected. The purpose is to generate a secure password that users can use. 

## USAGE

When users click Generate Password button a window will pop up asking different criterias to generate a random password. It will first ask, "How many characters would you like?", giving the user a textbox to input their response. Their response will need to be between 8 and 128 characters and provided as a number. If not, a window will pop up letting them know that the criteria has not been met. Users must have at least one character to continue generating a random password. Once all criteria has been met a generated password would appear onto the page.
